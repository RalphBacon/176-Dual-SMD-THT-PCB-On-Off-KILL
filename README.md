# Dual SMD & THT PCB (ATTiny85 On/Off/KILL) Arduino Shield
An easy to solder PCB with SMD components - or through-hole as a backup

### $2 PCB Prototype at https://jlcpcb.com/ (No closing on holidays)  
**Keep Production of Standard Prototype PCBs**  
**Specs: 2-layer, HASL, Green Solder Mask**  
**Keep delivering PCBs to your door**  

### SMD Novice? This is for you!

The circuit described in previous video #173 (https://youtu.be/S2y1oAVmxdA) has been put onto this dual format PCB so that you can try SMD soldering with large(r) components - and fallback to through-hole alternatives if it all gets a bit much!

This is an Arduino UNO R3 Shield and allows you to remotely (wired, two-wire switch) turn your Arduino on, off and kill it if it doesn't respond in a timely manner.

If I can do this with just one dodgy eye to solder with then you can too!

But, to increase the liklihood of success, try the **Banggood practice SMD kit** (link below) for less than $2 (incl shipping) first, then do this project.
